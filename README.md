Application that lets you keep track of your project in different development stages.
Users are able to register and log in. Once logged in, they can create their own projects which they can keep track off. Projects have different categories of development, and the user can modify those to whatever they want. If a user wants to, they can update their projects development status at any time. Each project is labeled by their creators, and only their creators have the ability to delete them.
